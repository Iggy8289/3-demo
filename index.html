            <h2>Learning Through Experimentation</h2>
            <p>Over the past year, OPTERRA's AI Community of Practice experimented with AI for real work challenges. Not theory or potential - actual daily tasks where we wanted to see: "Does this actually help?"</p>
            <p>Three capabilities emerged that proved consistently useful. Each represents a different level of complexity and time investment. Explore any that match where you'd like to start.</p>
